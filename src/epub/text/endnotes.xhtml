					<p>The passages omitted, here and elsewhere, in Miss Halcombe’s diary are only those which bear no reference to Miss Fairlie or to any of the persons with whom she is associated in these pages. <a href="chapter-1-3-1.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

My first and last concealments from the reader are those which caution renders absolutely necessary in this portion of the narrative. <a href="chapter-3-3-5.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
